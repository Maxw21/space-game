# space-game
Asteroid shooting game coded in Java. Started as a school project but then expanded upon as a personal project.

Removed audiofiles, currently using restricted method calls that throw errors. Will fix in near future.


This is a student based project for research and game programming practice. The game uses copyrighted material and images. I do not claim ownership over any of these works and all work and their rights belong to their respected owners.
